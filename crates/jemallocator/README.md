# tikv-jemallocator

[![ci]][github actions] [![Latest Version]][crates.io] [![docs]][docs.rs]

This project is the successor of [jemallocator](https://github.com/gnzlbg/jemallocator).

The project is also published as `jemallocator` for historical reasons. The two crates are the same except names. For new projects, it's recommended to use `tikv-xxx` versions instead.

> Links against `jemalloc` and provides a `Jemalloc` unit type that implements
> the allocator APIs and can be set as the `#[global_allocator]`

## Overview

The `jemalloc` support ecosystem consists of the following crates:

* `tikv-jemalloc-sys`: builds and links against `jemalloc` exposing raw C bindings to it.
* `tikv-jemallocator`: provides the `Jemalloc` type which implements the
  `GlobalAlloc` and `Alloc` traits. 
* `tikv-jemalloc-ctl`: high-level wrapper over `jemalloc`'s control and introspection
  APIs (the `mallctl*()` family of functions and the _MALLCTL NAMESPACE_)'

## Documentation

* [Latest release (docs.rs)][docs.rs]

To use `tikv-jemallocator` add it as a dependency:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]

[target.'cfg(not(target_env = "msvc"))'.dependencies]
tikv-jemallocator = "0.5"
```

To set `tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc` as the global allocator add this to your project:

```rust
// main.rs
#[cfg(not(target_env = "msvc"))]
use tikv_jemallocator::Jemalloc;

#[cfg(not(target_env = "msvc"))]
#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL: Jemalloc = Jemalloc;
```

And that's it! Once you've defined this `static` then jemalloc will be used for
all allocations requested by Rust code in the same program.

## Platform support

The following table describes the supported platforms: 

* `build`: does the library compile for the target?
* `run`: do `tikv-jemallocator` and `tikv-jemalloc-sys` tests pass on the target?
* `jemalloc`: do `tikv-jemalloc`'s tests pass on the target?

Tier 1 targets are tested on all Rust channels (stable, beta, and nightly). All
other targets are only tested on Rust nightly.
